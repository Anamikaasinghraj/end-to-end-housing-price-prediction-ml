## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict residential property prices using regression and ensemble boosting algorithms.

The solution follows an industry-standard workflow including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Cross-validation model comparison  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Model performance evaluation and error analysis  

The objective is to build a robust predictive model capable of generalizing well to unseen housing data.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Missing value imputation (median for numerical, most frequent for categorical)
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling for numerical variables
- Implemented using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`

---

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

- Derived additional ratio-based features
- Removed redundant columns
- Improved predictive performance through structured transformations

---

### 3️⃣ Model Comparison (Cross-Validation)

Models evaluated using K-Fold Cross Validation:

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- HistGradientBoosting Regressor  

Evaluation Metrics:

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- R² Score  

---

### 4️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning

- Applied `GridSearchCV` to optimize boosting model performance
- Selected best parameters based on cross-validation results

---

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation

- Compared cross-validation scores
- Analyzed residual distribution
- Evaluated predicted vs actual house prices

---

## 📈 Results & Observations

- Boosting models outperformed linear regression models.
- Cross-validation improved reliability of performance estimates.
